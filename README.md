**Weather Monitoring Application**

**Objective**
The objective of this project is to develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates.

**Tech Stack**:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. API: OpenWeatherMap
3. Database: SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
4. Visualization: Matplotlib
5. Web Framework: Flask (if web interface is required)

**Features**
1. Real-time weather data retrieval
2. Data processing and conversion
3. Daily summaries and aggregates
4. Alerting based on user-defined thresholds
5. Visualization of weather data

**Setup Instructions**
1. Installation
Clone the repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository named weather-monitoring. Clone the repository to your local machine

   Command:
   
   git clone https://github.com/manikantaindla/weather-monitoring
   cd weather-monitoring

3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies: Create and activate a virtual environment:

   Command:
   
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

   Install the required packages:
   
   Command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the application: Update the src/config.py file with your OpenWeatherMap API key and other settings.

4. Run the application:
   
   Command:
   
   python src/app.py

6. Testing
   Run tests:
   
   Ensure that all components are working as expected by running the unit tests:
   Command:
   
   python -m unittest discover tests

**Contributing**
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add new feature').
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

**Key Features**
1. Real-time Weather Data Retrieval: Continuously fetches weather data for multiple cities at specified intervals.
2. Data Processing and Conversion: Converts raw data into meaningful metrics, such as temperature in Celsius.
3. Daily Summaries and Aggregates: Aggregates weather data on a daily basis to provide summaries like average, maximum, and minimum temperatures, as well as dominant weather conditions.
4. Threshold-Based Alerts: Monitors temperature thresholds and generates alerts if certain conditions are met.
5. Data Storage: Uses SQLite for storing historical weather data.
6. Visualization: Generates visual representations of the weather data for better insights.
